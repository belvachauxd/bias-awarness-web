Unconscious bias has severely pressured individuals from different backgrounds, such as job-seeking and educational settings. 
It can influence our work interactions and decision-making, and if they are not addressed, they can have a negative effect on a company's atmosphere and team dynamics. 
Hence this platform can help the digital natives achieve greater awareness of their unconscious bias.

Senopia is the 'improvement of near vision sometimes occurring in the aged.' As the concept of distorted, unconscious perception is similar to the problem of near vision, 
the platform is named Senopia, which aims to raise awareness of younger generations on realizing their own unconscious bias and promote the correct values 
and behaviors through the online platform.

Senopia is an online platform with a self-guided and engaging journey to uncover and be more aware of their unconscious biases. 
Senopia uses the tech stack 'MERN' for account creation, discussion forums, and bias awareness tests to let the users discover their biases.
